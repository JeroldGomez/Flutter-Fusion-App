# Fusion    

Welcome to **Fusion** üëãüèª a comprehensive collection of activities integrated into a single Flutter application. This project was developed as a final term assignment for our course, showcasing our ability to collaborate and incorporate various Flutter projects from GitHub into our own application.

## Project Overview

**Fusion** is designed to be a multi-functional app that brings together different activities and features, demonstrating our skills in Flutter development and integration. Our objective was to create a seamless experience by merging different Flutter components and functionalities into a unified application.

## Features

- **Offline Functionality:** Fusion is designed to work entirely offline, making it reliable for use in environments with poor internet connectivity. All accounts are hardcoded to ensure functionality without network dependency.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across various devices, from the login page to the navigation drawer.
- **Integration of Multiple Projects:** Fusion includes 10 projects - 7 developed by our team and 3 sourced from GitHub, showcasing our ability to integrate and enhance different Flutter projects.

## Pages

1. **Login Page:** The entry point of the app, featuring a straightforward login interface with hardcoded accounts to facilitate offline access. 
2. **Navigation/Home Page:** Serves as the hub of the app, allowing users to navigate to different integrated projects. 
3. **Details Page:** Provides detailed information and interactions for each integrated project, including the description of each project, resources used for design (icons, images, fonts, colors), and information about each group member.

## Integrated Projects

### From Our Activities

1. **Color Game:** A simple betting game where users select colors to bet, roll the dice, and view outcomes. The interface displays chosen colors, available capital, and allows interactive betting actions.
2. **Xylophone:** A xylophone player using the 'audioplayers' package to produce distinct musical notes upon button press, with unique colors representing each xylophone key.
3. **Heart List:** Utilizes the english_words package to create and manage pairs of English words. Users can save their favorite names by tapping a heart icon next to each suggestion, with saved suggestions displayed on a separate page.
4. **3D Profile:** A basic 3D profile UI in Flutter, consisting of an AppBar with a customized title and a body section structured with nested Containers to create a 3D layered effect.
5. **Card Profile:** Features a centered Container representing a card that displays a person's name, educational background, and contact details in a structured layout.
6. **Calculator:** A simple calculator app with a UI containing two text containers for input and output, a customized keypad layout, and arithmetic operation buttons.
7. **To-Do List:** A To-Do List app with a StatefulWidget containing a list of todos, an addTodo method to add tasks via a dialog prompt, and a deleteTodo method to remove tasks by swiping.

### From GitHub

8. **Snake Game:** A game interface with a snake that moves across a grid, collecting food and growing longer. The game logic handles the snake's movement direction based on user gestures.
9. **Tetris:** A Tetris game application with an interface that includes the game screen, controls, and UI elements.
10. **Pixel Puzzle:** A simple slide puzzle game where the player arranges squares into the correct order.

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter:** The main framework used for developing the app.
- **Dart:** The programming language used in Flutter development.

## Limitations

While **Fusion** is designed to be a robust and versatile application, there are several limitations that users should be aware of:

1. **Offline Functionality Only:** The app is designed to function entirely offline due to poor internet connectivity in our school. This means it does not support any online features such as real-time data synchronization or cloud storage.
2. **Hardcoded Accounts:** For simplicity and to ensure offline functionality, user accounts are hardcoded. This limits the flexibility for users to create or manage their own accounts and restricts the app to a fixed set of users.
3. **Limited Customization:** The app has a fixed set of features and activities. Users cannot add or remove activities, nor can they customize the existing ones beyond the provided functionality.
4. **No Real-Time Updates:** Since the app operates offline, any updates to the app or its content must be done manually by updating the codebase and redeploying the app.
5. **Performance on Low-End Devices:** While we have made efforts to ensure the app is responsive, there might be performance issues on older or low-end devices, particularly with more resource-intensive activities like the Snake Game or Tetris.
6. **Data Persistence:** Data persistence is limited to the duration of the app session. Once the app is closed, any data that was not explicitly saved within the scope of the app's local storage capabilities will be lost.
7. **Scope of Integration:** The integration of projects is limited to the scope of our term project. While we have successfully integrated 10 different projects, expanding this further would require significant additional development and testing.
8. **User Interface Constraints:** The user interface, while designed to be responsive, may not be fully optimized for all screen sizes and orientations. Some elements might not scale perfectly on very small or very large screens.
9. **Limited Error Handling:** Error handling is basic and might not cover all edge cases. Users may experience unhandled exceptions or crashes under certain conditions.
10. **Limited Documentation:** While we have provided documentation within the README and comments within the code, there may be aspects of the app that are not fully documented, which could pose challenges for future development or debugging.

We acknowledge these limitations and appreciate any feedback or suggestions for future improvements.
